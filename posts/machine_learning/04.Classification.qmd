#### __Intro__
In this project, we aim to apply the One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for anomaly detection on the Dow Jones dataset from seaborn. The dataset comprises two columns: Date and Price, making it a suitable candidate for time-series anomaly detection. The One-Class SVM method is particularly effective for such tasks as it defines a boundary around normal data, and any data point falling outside this boundary is considered an anomaly. By leveraging this method, we hope to identify unusual patterns in the Dow Jones index that could potentially indicate significant financial events or market abnormalities. This approach could provide valuable insights for financial analysis and decision-making processes. Stay tuned as we dive into the details of implementing and optimizing the One-Class SVM model for our dataset.

#### __Necessary Packages__
```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler

plt.style.use('ggplot')
print(f"List of seaborn datasets: \n{sns.get_dataset_names()}")
```

the order of executing block changes results 
jupyter notebook 中未运行的代码块对后面代码块无影响
```{python}
import numpy as np
```
```{python}
print(np.__version__)
```
the order of executing block changes results 
jupyter notebook 代码运行顺序对结果有影响
```{python}
a=5
```
```{python}
print(a)
```
```{python}
a=6
```
If you run the last code block before the print block, the output will show that a is 6.
